### **A Very Important Warning About Render**

While pushing these images solves your problem for **displaying** products, you need to know how Render (and most cloud platforms like Heroku/Vercel) works:

**Render has an "Ephemeral Filesystem" (Temporary Storage).**

* **What this means:** Every time you deploy new code or your server restarts (which happens automatically), Render **wipes the hard drive clean** and re-clones the fresh code from GitHub.
* **The Result:**
    1.  **Your Product Images (Pushed to Git):** ✅ **SAFE.** They are in the repo, so they get re-downloaded every time.
    2.  **New User Uploads (Not in Git):** ❌ **UNSAFE.** If a user signs up tomorrow and uploads a profile picture *while the site is running*, that picture will **disappear** the next time you deploy or restart the server.

**Summary:**
For this project right now, **pushing the `uploads` folder is the correct solution.** It will ensure your products and sliders appear on your live site.

Just keep in mind for future "real" professional apps, developers usually store uploaded images on a cloud service like **AWS S3** or **Cloudinary** to prevent them from being deleted on server restarts.
